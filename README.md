# industry-employment
Scrapes NY Department of Labor's employment by industry data for Nassau & Suffolk county only.

## Things to note
 - data is presented in thousands
 - data is not seasonally adjusted.
 - script currently fires on git push
 - csvs are not organized (refer to the supersector tree here: https://www.bls.gov/iag/tgs/iag_index_naics.htm)

## Issues
 - Fails intermittently, need to double check
